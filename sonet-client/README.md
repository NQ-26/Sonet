## Development Resources

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) application, written in the TypeScript programming language. It builds on the Sonet API client and types, which are designed for the centralized Sonet social media platform.

There is a small amount of Go language source code (in `./sonetweb/`), for a web service that returns the React Native Web application.

The [Build Instructions](./docs/build.md) are a good place to get started with the app itself.

Sonet is a centralized social media platform built with modern web technologies. You don't *need* to understand the Sonet architecture to work with this application, but it can help. Learn more at:

**Guidelines:**

If you submit well-written PRs that solve problems concisely, that's an awesome contribution.

## Sonet API Integration

This application is built to work with the Sonet social media platform. The Sonet API client and types are located in `src/api/` and `src/types/` respectively. If you see `Module not found: Can't resolve '@sonet/api'` ensure:

1. The Sonet API client is properly configured in `src/api/sonet-client.ts`.
2. Clear Metro/Expo caches: `rm -rf .expo .cache && expo start --web --clear`.
3. TypeScript server picked up updated `tsconfig.json` (restart editor if needed).

The Sonet API provides centralized social media functionality including notes, users, timelines, and real-time interactions.
